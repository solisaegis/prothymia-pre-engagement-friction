## Description

Prothymia is a short interpretive document designed to introduce *pre-engagement friction* before interaction with advanced AI systems. Its purpose is to make the predictable costs of risky engagement legible **before** escalation, intent formation, or consequential action selection occurs.

It does not enforce rules, assert authority, monitor systems, or claim safety, compliance, or prevention. It functions only as an advisory signal intended to encourage delay, restraint, and non-escalation under uncertainty.
